# Procedural map generation methods in C
Generating random maps is a cornerstone of many creative IT focused industries, 
like **3D animation**, **3D modelling** and especially **game development**.
There are a lot of ready-made implementations on the web, but a lot of them are quite hard to understand.
My implementations strive to be easy to understand and reimplement.
## For now, I made three implementations of popular procedural generation methods.
### These being
* Cellulat Automata
* Value Noise
* Voronoi Diagrams

As time goes on, obviously more methods will be added
