# Procedural map generation methods in C
Generating random maps is a cornerstone of many creative IT focused industries, 
like **3D animation**, **3D modelling** and especially **game development**.
There are a lot of ready-made implementations on the web, but a lot of them are quite hard to understand.
My implementations strive to be easy to understand and reimplement.

In depth explenations of the algorithms will be in each directory.
### For now, I made three implementations of popular procedural generation methods.
#### These being:
* [Cellular Automata](../main/cellular_automata)
* [Value Noise](../main/value_noise)
* [Voronoi Diagrams](../main/voronoi)
* [Worley Noise](../main/voronoi)

*Graphical examples made using the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) graphics library*

As time goes on, obviously more methods will be added.
